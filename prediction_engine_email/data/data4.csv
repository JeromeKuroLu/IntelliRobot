Others_VGM!@#RE : VGM Reminder 4999921330 - Please provide VGM info!@#Hi Laura , Sorry for belated reply , we will help you input this VGM reference into our system so the terminal will receive it . _time_ If you choose to submit your VGM reference directly to the terminal , then you will need to wait until the container is input into the terminal ' s system . Alternatively , you can provide your VGM reference to us , and it will go through to the terminal ' s system without having to wait for the container input , and appear on your invoice . _time_ In order for us to process your VGM , can you please confirm the following ? 1 . Will your CNS badge code be “ ZENITHINT ” ? 2 . The reference you would like to appear on your invoice ( e . g . booking number )
Others_VGM!@#FW : VGM Reminder 4999921330 - Please provide VGM info!@#Hi Rozelle , Could you advise if the customer request to _City_ the VGM submission as TL ( like the same case as attached ) ? And shall we reply the customer at the same way ? Thanks for your help in advance !
Others_VGM!@#RE : _City_ 4999921080!@#Hi Tiffany Yes , that ’ s right : )
Others_VGM!@#RE : _City_ 4999921080!@#Hello Rozelle , To further clarify , if customers have not submitted a badge code to either OOCL or the terminal directly , then the terminal will charge OOCL ’ s badge code by default , hence the GBP 20 . 50 charge ? Thanks : )
Others_VGM!@#RE : _City_ 4999921080!@#Hi Tiffany Apologies for the delay , the customer has not entered their VGM billing account information before the deadline , therefore we will charge the customer accordingly . ( They can expect an invoice for GBP 20 . 50 ) . Since the terminal can provide a VGM if the shipper VGM is missing the container has already loaded to the vessel , as per below screenshot from CNS .
Others_VGM!@#RE : _City_ 4999921080!@#Hi Tiffany If the customer wants to do it themselves in CNS then that is fine , we do not have a problem with this , so long as they enter their VGM Billing account into CNS . I have put a red _City_ around where their CNS Organisation code needs to be entered in CNS . If the customer cannot do this , then they will need to provide us with their CNS Organisation code so that the terminal can charge them accordingly , otherwise the charge will come to OOCL and we will have to pass it on . Hope this helps .
Others_VGM!@#FW : _City_ 4999921080!@#Hello Rozelle , Regarding the shipment missing VGM , customer has replied us as below . We know that regardless of weighing method , we still require a VGM reference . However , customer ’ s understanding seems to be that TL _City_ they can skip supplying VGM reference to OOCL . We were wondering if there is a reason we can give to aid our explanation of why we still need a VGM from them .
