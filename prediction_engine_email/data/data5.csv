Others_VGM!@#RE : _Destination_!@#Hi Tiffany Yes , that ’ s right : )
Others_VGM!@#RE : _Destination_!@#Hello Rozelle , To further clarify , if customers have not submitted a badge code to either OOCL or the terminal directly , then the terminal will charge OOCL ’ s badge code by default , hence the GBP 20 . 50 charge ? Thanks : )
Others_VGM!@#RE : _Destination_!@#Hi Tiffany Apologies for the delay , the customer has not entered their VGM billing account information before the deadline , therefore we will charge the customer accordingly . ( They can expect an invoice for GBP 20 . 50 ) . Since the terminal can provide a VGM if the shipper VGM is missing the container has already loaded to the vessel , as per below screenshot from CNS .
Others_VGM!@#RE : _Destination_!@#Hi Tiffany If the customer wants to do it themselves in CNS then that is fine , we do not have a problem with this , so long as they enter their VGM Billing account into CNS . I have put a red _City_ around where their CNS Organisation code needs to be entered in CNS . If the customer cannot do this , then they will need to provide us with their CNS Organisation code so that the terminal can charge them accordingly , otherwise the charge will come to OOCL and we will have to pass it on . Hope this helps .
Others_VGM!@#FW : _Destination_!@#Hello Rozelle , Regarding the shipment missing VGM , customer has replied us as below .
